    Iâ€™m a tech-savvy entrepreneur who is always on the move and enjoys taking on
    responsibilities and solving problems as they arise. My passion for
    technology was evident from a young age, particularly when I successfully
    created a simple jump-and-run game using GW Basic at the age of 10.
